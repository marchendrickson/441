# Week One

### Marc Hendrickson

The first week of this class went very smooth for me. I was able to create a static web page over the course of an hour.
In my most recent job outside of school we used the bootstrap icon css sheet so I figured why not throw it in there along with the 
animate.css sheet to make the icons bounce. I did want to add a hover element to the icon, but the style that I added inside the HTML seems like the only way that I can style the icon. Otherwise when I try to add the style in my CSS sheet it just reverts back to the original style in the linked icon stylesheet. 

I tried to learn a little javascript and jquery over the summer by myself but found it too hard to not have deadlines, so I am excited to 
learn a little bit more about that aspect of Web Development in this class.
