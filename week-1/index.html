              <h3> Experience</h3>
              <p> After taking Web Development last spring I was looking to further my coding skills.<br/><br/>
                During the summer I built a website for my friend as well as took some more coding camps.<br/><br/>
                Currently I am working on a freelance job for Ebben Marketing Group. The website build is almost done and should be active within the next couple of weeks.</p>

              <h3>Goals</h3>
              <p> I am taking this class to further understand and get practice coding. After, I am planning on working more
                freelance jobs in Web Development, GIS, and Cartography until I land a permenant job in these fields.</p>

      <h3> A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p> I love to ski, climb, backpack, and packraft which is why I moved up to Montana from Colorado. While there are big mountains in CO there is nothing like the emptiness of
        Montana's wilderness. My love for the wilderness caused an affinity for mapping, which I am hoping will be able to be my ultimate career path. However, I am also really excited
        about Web Development and Graphic Design as well. Who knows which path I will choose to follow but I know it will be a fun experience whichever path I follow.
