# HW-4 Readme for Marc Hendrickson

## Problems

I feel like everyone else. This was a hard week, full of new material and lots that I did not understand. Luckily I did manage to get through the first 2 problems without looking up too much material.
However problems 3 & 4 were a little bit out of my league. I was able to conceptualize the steps for problem 3 which I helped me out in the long run to try to solve the errors that I was making.
For problem 4 I was able to write the initial range function no problem, however when it came to including the step I had to look up solutions online and work them into my code. I worked on the 'function SUM' for
a long time, and it ended up that I misspelled length which caused the function not to run.

## Problem 5

I was not able to get to problem 5 in time for today, I have way to many other obligations that are getting in the way. I may be able to get to it tonight but I wanted to submit something just in case.
