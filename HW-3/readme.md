# HW-3 Readme for Marc Hendrickson

This week snuck up on me. I was able to read the book and the various materials fairly early on last week, but my other classes had some big projects due this week so I was not able to get to this class as quickly as I wanted to.

### Actual Problems

I am fairly confident at my ability to follow directions, which I feel like HTML and CSS is all about, however, these open ended problems are definately a brain buster for me. Thankfully, I persevered and was able to outline how I would approach them before I started to write the code.
