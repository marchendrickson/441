### Week 2 Homework

# Marc Hendrickson

This week was very easy. I am very thankful for this because I have a lot of other assignments going on in my other classes. For instance, in my Python class we are going over all the basics but it seems to me to be a little bit harder than JavaScript. I psyched to learn my first JavaScript, hopefully I am on my way to become a master!!

I haven't been able to help my fellow classmates yet. This is because there haven't been too many issues yet but also cause I haven't been quick on the draw on the forum.
