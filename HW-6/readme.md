# HW-6 Readme for YOUR_NAME

## Marc Hendrickson

I have been absent from this class for the past two weeks. I have been finishing up my work for the Ebben Marketing Agency, and also working towards my first professional GIS/Cartography job.

For some reason I was having a hard time with the basics of JavaScript when we were just printing to the console, but now that we have started working with HTML it seems conceptually much easier for me.

I had a little bit of a problem with the final step of appending the whole sheet with my changes, but through trial and error as well as looking over some other material I was able to find a solution.
